## USP

This application is **not a social media platform** but a **professional profile-building space**. It helps students build their vocational profiles, work part-time to earn their living costs, and make decisions for themselves.

## THE FLN SCORING SYSTEM: 
This is an assessment system where using ML model( for checking the fluency of the user in English speech ) and vector storage (for retrieval of their literacy and numeracy baseed tests ). This would be a game changer while comparing two employs who are to work at a place. This assessment would assure that they are 
**1. FLUENT IN ENGLISH
2. THEY ARE LITERATE
3. THEY HAVE SANE NUMERICAL IDEAS.**
This would provide the employers as a one stop hiring solution as well as would provide the students a respectable platform to gain a part time job.
